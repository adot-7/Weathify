A basic client-side web app for getting the weather conditions, like temperature, humidity, etc. based on your location.  

Keeping the API key exposed as I got it from another repository by searching on github hehe.

Interestingly enough, I don't know JS as of writing this, but a major component of this code depends on JS for sending requests and getting response from the openWeather API. I was able to understand and tweak the JS code since it's a high-level language but I used a very famous LLM from a multibillion dollar company(thou shall not be named) for getting the boilerplate for all this.

This is for a task given by the GDSC leads of my university. As I am currently working on another app, I was not able to dedicate more time to this project, so LLMs for the win i guess.
