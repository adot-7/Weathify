A basic client-side web app for getting the weather conditions, like temperature, humidity, etc. based on your location.  

Keeping the API key exposed as I got it from another repository by searching on github hehe.

This is for a task given by the GDSC leads of my university. As I am currently working on another app, I was not able to dedicate more time to this project, so LLMs for the win i guess.
